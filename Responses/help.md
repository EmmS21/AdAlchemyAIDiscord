## How does AdAlchemyAI work?

### Market Researcher
Think of it as a series of AI Assistants working together. One starts off browsing the internet to your site to understand what your business does and who your target users, grouping them into user personas. Let's call this the Market Researcher

You are able to the Market Researcher's output using the Discord Bot. You can train your Market Researcher by adding more context to;
- what your business does
- your value proposition
- who your target users are
- your user personas

You do this using slash commands you will have access to after being onboarded. 

#### Paths
The Market Researcher also thinks up paths, think of paths as different ways each user persona could use Google to search for content that could be seen as a proxy of them having some intent to interact with your product. For example, if I am reading up a lot about travelling to the Bahamas, this could be a proxy for me having the intention to buy an air ticket....so you may want to show me an for air tickets discounts. 

You can view the paths this Market Researcher prepares, editing and adding new paths to cover a wider scope of 'paths' using your Discord Bot

### Keyword Researcher
The Keyword Researcher uses the output generated by the Market Researcher to surf the internet through all the paths layed out multiple times. Each time, the Keyword Reseacher keeps a running record of keywords it is using that generate content that people who could be your leads might be reading. The Keyword Researcher has access to other tools to understand which keywords could bring in good leads for a lower cost.

You can use the Discord Bot to train your Keywords Reseacher by;
- approving the keywords
- approving the ad text

You will need to carry out these steps before any ads are created. The next assistant will only use the keywords and ad text you have approved. This will be used to train your Keyword Researcher going forward to help it make more relevant keywords and ad text.

### Digital Marketer
The Digital Marketer is responsible for creating your ads. However, it will not act until you have approved the keywords and ad text it can use. Before you use the Digital Marketer you will need to use your Discord Bot to;
- set a daily budget for your campaign
- manually trigger the Digital Marketer to run your ads, stipulate the number of ads you want and approve your new ads

You can stop this ad at any point

### Analyst

The Analyst monitors how your ad is doing, to suggest ways you can improve your ad. You can either approve these changes or reject them.

You can use your bot to check how your ad is performing based on the metrics you find most valuable.

## Next Steps
Before you have full access to the AdAlchemyAI, we will need to have an onboarding call.

## What is the Onboarding call about?
This is a chance for me to learn more about your business and ask questions to understand the biggest pain points in your marketing pipeline. I want to understand how you get leads, what you spend and how you want to track the efficacy of this AdAlchemyAI

## How does the pricing work?
As this is operating as a beta, the pricing will vary depending on your usage and the scope of your use case. You will be given a free trial

## Anything I need to provide
The bot will need to be given access to your Google Ads. This will require access to credentials to enable the bot to create and terminate ads.
